# Skip Size Selector - Modern React Application

## Project Overview

This project is a modern, responsive web application for selecting and ordering skips of various sizes. The application features a sleek, user-friendly interface with smooth animations and a well-thought-out component architecture.

## Design Approach

### 1. Component Architecture

The project follows a modular component architecture, organized into three main categories:

```
src/
  components/
    layout/      # Core layout components
    skips/       # Skip-specific components
    ui/          # Reusable UI components
  pages/         # Page components
```

#### Layout Components

- `Header.jsx` - Main navigation and branding
- `Footer.jsx` - Contact information and help section

#### Skip Components

- `SkipHero.jsx` - Hero section with main heading
- `SkipCard.jsx` - Individual skip card with selection functionality
- `SkipFeatures.jsx` - Features list for each skip
- `SkipPricing.jsx` - Pricing section with selection button
- `SkipSummary.jsx` - Detailed summary in slide-over panel

#### UI Components

- `Button.jsx` - Reusable button component
- `Badge.jsx` - Category and status indicators
- `SlideOver.jsx` - Slide-in panel for detailed views

### 2. Visual Design

#### Color Scheme

- Primary gradient: Cyan to Blue (`from-cyan-500 to-blue-500`)
- Background: Dark slate gradients with subtle transparency
- Accents: Green for success, Amber for warnings
- Text: White for headings, Slate variations for body text

#### Design Features

- Glassmorphic UI elements with backdrop blur
- Subtle gradients for depth and visual hierarchy
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Responsive layout with mobile-first approach

### 3. User Experience

#### Interaction Design

- Immediate visual feedback on selection
- Smooth hover effects and transitions
- Modern slide-over panel for detailed information
- Clear visual hierarchy in information presentation

#### Animations

Custom animations include:

- Fade-in effects for content entry
- Slide-up animations with staggered delays
- Scale transitions on hover
- Smooth panel transitions

### 4. Technical Implementation

#### Key Technologies

- React for UI components
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Modern JavaScript features
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts

#### State Management

- React hooks for local state
- Prop drilling for component communication
- Event handlers for user interactions

#### Performance Considerations

- Optimized animations
- Lazy loading where applicable
- Efficient re-rendering strategies
- Mobile-first responsive design

### 5. Code Organization

#### Component Structure

Each component follows a consistent pattern:

- Clear props definition
- Semantic HTML structure
- Tailwind CSS classes
- Proper event handling

#### Styling Approach

- Utility-first with Tailwind CSS
- Custom animations and transitions
- Consistent spacing and sizing
- Responsive design patterns

### 6. Accessibility Features

- ARIA labels and roles
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly content
- Proper heading hierarchy

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
